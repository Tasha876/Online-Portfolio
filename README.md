## 1. Description
This portfolio contains several projects completed during my time at the [University of Toronto School for Continuing Studies Coding Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.learn.utoronto.ca/). It also contains a brief **about me** section, a **contact me** form and a link to my **resume**.

#### Note:
Rather than having several pages that link to each other, I used [scrollspy](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/scrollspy/) (by Bootstrap) to have the links be scrolled to. This was a stylistic change that I think makes my portfolio more on trend.

### Summary of Entries

#### NOVELty (Horiseon Marketing)
Working as a team, we created NOVELty. It allows you to add books that you have read or have finished reading, then recommends books to you based on your input.

#### Online portfolio website 
Right now, because I have very limited entries, I have included this website. I will remove this once I have more entries.

#### Password Generator
This password generator, still to be created at this time, creates strong passwords according to the types (i.e. uppercase, lowercase, numeric, special) of characters the user would like. The character types are entered by the user. Because this project has yet to be completed, there is a link to an *"Under construction"* site.

## 5. Next steps
This portfolio is an ongoing project. Some next steps include:
* adding the password generator,
* adding larger thumbnails and finding a way to make larger thumbnails work with the design,
* adding more interativity such as a [full screen scroller](https://mdbootstrap.com/previews/docs/latest/html/fsscroller/extended.html#view-2),
* adding many more projects.
