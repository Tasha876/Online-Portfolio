## 1. Description
This portfolio contains several projects completed during my time at the [University of Toronto School for Continuing Studies Coding Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.learn.utoronto.ca/). It also contains a brief **about me** section, a **contact me** form and a link to my **resume**.

#### Note:
Rather than having several pages that link to each other, I used [scrollspy](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/scrollspy/) (by Bootstrap) to have the links be scrolled to. This was a stylistic change that I think makes my portfolio more on trend.

### Summary of Entries

#### NOVELty
Working as a team, we created NOVELty. It allows you to add books that you have read or have finished reading, then recommends books to you based on your input.

#### Eat da Burger 
I created a burger logger called Eat da Burger. It allows you to add, eat, and delete (virtual!) burgers! It also saves your current burgers and loads them for the next time.

#### Servicely
Working with a team, we created Servicely â€” an app that helps you either find help when your in need or help if you're feeling generous.

#### Password Generator
I created a simple password generator. It generates strong passwords using Javascript.

## 5. Next steps
This portfolio is an ongoing project. Some next steps include:
* decreasing the size of the images to make loading faster.
* adding more interativity such as a [full screen scroller](https://mdbootstrap.com/previews/docs/latest/html/fsscroller/extended.html#view-2),
* adding many more projects.
